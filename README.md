# esp-caps
ESP/CAPS is an open source software for multidisciplinary, parametric CAD geometry. ESP/CAPS stands for Engineering Sketch Pad / Computational Aircraft Prototype Synthesis. The source code is available on the ACDL MIT website, https://acdl.mit.edu/ESP/. A GUI is available for designing aerodynamic CAD geometries. A number of Analysis Interface Modules or AIMs export input files to various fluid / structural analyses and communicate derivative information as well. The CAD geometry is built on OpenCASCADE with mesh derivatives available.

This github site deploys an anaconda package of ESP/CAPS hosted by the smdogroup.
The package can be installed with the following command.
```
conda install -c smdogroup esp-caps
```
